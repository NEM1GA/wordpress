## CI/CD pipeline description:
As soon as push received in branch "main" to project Git repo, Github Actions runs CI/CD pipeline: repo checkout > automatically bump realise version and push tag > build docker image and pushe it to DockerHub > install helm and check out a helm chart by kubeval > Helm creates a new artifact and push it to JFrog Artifactory > send a success Slack notification, along with pipeline will fail, we will receive an alert notification in Slack. As per changes on GitHub repo, Argo CD detects it and starts deploying required Helm chart in the Kubernetes cluster.
